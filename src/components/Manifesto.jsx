                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. And good
                        privacy
                        needs good security foundations. Especially today, in a digital age full of people,
                        organizations or
                        governments that want to control you, your money or your data. Therefore, the second edition of
                        ETHBrno (ETHBrno²) will be mainly dedicated to these important topics ― privacy & security.</p>

                        Our hackathon is for everyone who understands the urgency of these issues and wants to help. We
                        want
                        to present the current progress in this sector as well as the projects, technologies and people
                        involved. We are Ethereum people, but we welcome creators and fans of all blockchains and
                        directions.</p>

                        Let's learn together to defend against all threats, whether it's loss of privacy and state
                        oppression, smart-contract exploits or simple phishing scams. Let's learn how to analyse them
                        retrospectively. Let's learn how to use the right tools, and if we don't have them, let's create
                        them together.</p>
